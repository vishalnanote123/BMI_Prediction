Discription:

A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight.
The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced.
Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female

Height : Number (cm)

Weight : Number (Kg)

Index :
0 - Extremely Weak
1 - Weak
2 - Normal
3 - Overweight
4 - Obesity
5 - Extreme Obesity

Objective:

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

Build classification models to predict the various categories of BMI.

Compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms
